Hello Kitty is making the world a little&nbsp;brighter!&nbsp; The&nbsp;Hello Kitty&nbsp;Flashlight Keychain shines 2 lights on all your fun.&nbsp; Push the 3-way switch up to turn the main light on, and down to illuminate the flower! *retired*
3-way switch
Battery not included (1 AAA) replaceable
2 different lights: main beam and flower
The&nbsp;Hello Kitty Flashlight Key chain measures about 3" tall by 2" wide and is attached to a quality metal keychain&nbsp;that includes&nbsp;a metal key clasp.&nbsp; This key chain is brand new and sealed in the manufacturer's original package and is a genuine Sanrio licensed Basic Fun collectible. Because this is
a vintage retired item, the battery that is already in the flashlight will most likely
not last very long, but it is replaceable with 1 AAA battery. &nbsp;Please be advised that this keychain is sold as
"battery NOT included" because of this possibility.&nbsp;
