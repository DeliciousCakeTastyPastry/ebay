Works perfect
Small black box is the AC to variable DC driver. 3 wire - load line and ground. If you wish I can put a 3 prong connection to use on regular house hold outlets. Powers 132 watts with this driver. With another driver it can power up to 286 watts with a fan on it.
Contains 72 osram gold Dragon plus leds
This is not a cheap knockoff. Does not use generic leds.
Each LED retails at $5.62 this has 72 of them. I have other dimmable drivers up to 300 watts for this
