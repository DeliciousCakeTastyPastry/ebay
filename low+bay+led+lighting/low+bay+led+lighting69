However, if you have modified your lights	to use&nbsp;	LEDs, you'll notice that the turn signals now blink very quickly. This&nbsp;	is caused by the low resistance of the LEDs due to	the fact&nbsp;	that they use less energy. To correct the problem, you'll need to wire&nbsp;	the turn signals in a parallel circuit. To do&nbsp;	this, you'll be installing a resistor&nbsp;	or control flasher.(SEE&nbsp;	FAQ)	　	　	　	● Quantity: As Title&nbsp;	Indicates	● We use ANTI-STATICS&nbsp;	ELECTRICITY BAG to pack your order but not LOW-QUALITY BLISTER CARD&nbsp;	unless mentioned by the &nbsp;&nbsp; buyer.&nbsp;	(Do you know that LED is Electrical Component and ANTI-STATICS ELECTRICITY&nbsp;	ACTION IS compulsory to be taken &nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp;&nbsp;	the LED maybe out of order before you use it!)	● Click to see the&nbsp;	Demo of ANTI- STATICS ELECTRICITY and	Blister Card	　	　	　	● FREE SHIPPING CHARGE FOR Registered&nbsp;	Mail with Tracking No. no matter where you buy from,,&nbsp;	if buyers need other shipping &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	such as&nbsp; EXPRESS DELIVERY, please contact us for quotation	●&nbsp;All&nbsp;	shipments will be written "GIFT" for custom clearance, basically there&nbsp;	is no tax expense occurs, buyers have responsibility &nbsp;&nbsp; for the duty or tax if happens.	●&nbsp;Buyer&nbsp;	has the responsibility to provide the correct deliver address along&nbsp;	with other necessary contact information.
