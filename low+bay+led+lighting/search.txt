The GAU-LB-600E LED 60 Watt Low Canopy Light offers high light output from a compact form factor and is designed to provide a more durable and longer lived alternative to 500 watt quartz halogen units. This 60 watt LED light produces a far superior beam spread without the high heat, fragile construction, or high energy costs of incandescent lighting. The GAU-LB-600E LED low canopy light from Larson Electronics is a low profile, low heat lighting option that produces 5400 lumens of light while drawing only 0.5 amps at 120 VAC. The lights are assembled on a light board and consist of a total of forty-five CREE LEDs paired with high purity specular optics to produce a wide light distribution that overpowers 500 watt quartz flood lights. The GAU-LB-600E is unique in that the LED lights are not assembled on a flat board, like traditional LED low canopy lights. The LED lights in this unit are divided into three separate light boards; a center light that shines straight forward and two 45° light boards on either side, creating the most optimal beam spread possible for low canopy lights. This low canopy, low bay LED light fixture is perfect for a number of applications, such as in parking lots, malls, and hallways, to light canopies and awnings, and even for parking lot lighting. The GAU-LB-600E consists of forty-five LEDs housed in a powder coated, IP68 waterproof aluminum 9" x 6.5" housing unit. This unit sufficiently dissipates generated heat with an internal heat sink, which helps account for the low utility bills and the estimated 50,000 hours of light associated with LEDs. The LED lamp assembly is protected by a shatterproof polycarbonate lens which is secured to the housing with a waterproof seal. The mounting hardware for the GAU-LB-600E consists of a stainless steel coated bracket and stainless steel screws to provide secure mounting and resistance to rust and corrosion.FEATURES60 watt LED light produces 5,400 lumens of light while drawing only 0.5 amps at 120V AC.Solid state design of the LED provides 50,000 hours of operation.Powder coated aluminum 9 inch by 6.5 inch housing is IP68 rated waterproof.Mounting assembly provides for 360 degree rotation and 180 degrees tilt.Light is designed to operate with voltages ranging from 110 VAC to 277 VAC 50/60 hz.SPECIFICATIONS Manufacturer: Larson Electronics LLC Shipping Weight: 690 Product Dimensions: width: 7.40length: 9.10depth: 5.30 SHIPPING TERMSDepending on your location and on package weight, items will be shipped by FedEx USPS or UPS.We usually ship within 24 hours of processing the payment.

Retrofitting these fixtures with our LED for HID lamps allows you to keep the “look” while taking advantage of the cost savings and light quality of LED.Lower Cost:&nbsp;Full LED fixtures usually are many times more expensive than LED for HID retrofit lamps and thus deliver much higher return on investment and much quicker payback.It’s easy:&nbsp;With our convenient retrofits, you simply bypass the ballast and screw it in. Plus, future servicing can be done without an electrician.It’s upgradeable:&nbsp;As technology advancements provide more efficient high-powered LEDs at a lower cost, our retrofit solutions are an easy way to upgrade.SPECIFICATIONSBulb Type:Site / WarehouseBulb Material:Aluminum / Poly-CarbonateLumens:5413 (4200K) / 5193 (5700K)Dimensions:5.91" X 7.8"Input Voltage:120-277VAC (120-347VAC Canada)CRI:84.4 / 86Lumens Per Watt:103.5 / 98.9 LPWBase Type:E26 EdisonReplaces:175W MHLifetime (hours):Up to 50,000Output Power:52WBeam Angle:120Color:Daylight (5700K)Dimmable:NoAPPLICATIONSLED Low Bay/Site Utility Series lamps can impact energy usage and costs in a major way for communities and housing developments with minimal to no maintenance costs thanks to the up to 50,000 hour lamp life.Site / Roadway / Post TopSecurity lightingParks and quadsMunicipal lightingParking GarageLow Bay ApplicationsPRODUCT NOTESWhen installing LED-8000 series retrofit lamps within HID fixtures,&nbsp;ballast must be&nbsp;bypassed&nbsp;when present.LED-8000 series retrofits are UL damp rated, sealing the existing HID&nbsp;fixture after installation will deliver best results.Installing surge/lightning protectors is highly recommended and helps to eliminate premature driver failure caused by surges and other power fluctuations.Hampton Bay Low Volt Multi-color LED 3-Pack Flower Light w/Remote ( see our other&nbsp;listings&nbsp;for this item with multiple&nbsp;counts )PRODUCT OVERVIEWModel #&nbsp;29504Internet #&nbsp;203634187Store SKU #&nbsp;909015Add some beauty and whimsy to your garden or pathways with the Low-Volt age LED Flower Light 3-Pack.

However the&nbsp;purpose to use LED BULB is energy saving, which means the car computer will&nbsp;misjudge the LED BULB not work because of the low wattage to lead the error signal showed in your dashboard. Basically&nbsp;the bulb can be judged OK when the wattage goes up to 5 Watt and above,all LED BULBs themselves have nothing to do with&nbsp;this problem except you install resistor to enlarge the wattage (SEE FAQ)　-- HYPER FLASH SPEED FOR SIGNAL/TURN LIGHT APPLICATION--Normally when you&nbsp;flip your turn signal switch, the light blinks at a set, slow pace. However, if&nbsp;you have modified your lightsto use LEDs,&nbsp;you'll notice that the turn signals now blink very quickly. This is caused by&nbsp;the low resistance of the LEDs due tothe fact that&nbsp;they use less energy. To correct the problem, you'll need to wire the turn&nbsp;signals in a parallel circuit. To do this,&nbsp;you'll be installing a resistor or control&nbsp;flasher.(SEE FAQ)&nbsp;　　　● Quantity: As Title Indicates● We use ANTI-STATICS&nbsp;ELECTRICITY BAG to pack your order but not LOW-QUALITY BLISTER CARD unless&nbsp;mentioned by the &nbsp;&nbsp; buyer.

Basically&nbsp;the bulb can be judged OK when the wattage goes up to 5 Watt and above,all LED BULBs themselves have nothing to do with&nbsp;this problem except you install resistor to enlarge the wattage (SEE FAQ)　-- HYPER FLASH SPEED FOR SIGNAL/TURN LIGHT APPLICATION--Normally when you&nbsp;flip your turn signal switch, the light blinks at a set, slow pace. However, if&nbsp;you have modified your lightsto use LEDs,&nbsp;you'll notice that the turn signals now blink very quickly. This is caused by&nbsp;the low resistance of the LEDs due tothe fact that&nbsp;they use less energy. To correct the problem, you'll need to wire the turn&nbsp;signals in a parallel circuit. To do this,&nbsp;you'll be installing a resistor or control&nbsp;flasher.(SEE FAQ)　　　● Quantity: As Title Indicates● We use ANTI-STATICS&nbsp;ELECTRICITY BAG to pack your order but not LOW-QUALITY BLISTER CARD unless&nbsp;mentioned by the &nbsp;&nbsp; buyer.
