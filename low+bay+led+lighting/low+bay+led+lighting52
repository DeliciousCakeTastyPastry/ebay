However the&nbsp;purpose to use LED BULB is energy saving, which means the car computer will&nbsp;misjudge the LED BULB not work because of the low wattage to lead the error signal showed in your dashboard. Basically&nbsp;the bulb can be judged OK when the wattage goes up to 5 Watt and above,all LED BULBs themselves have nothing to do with&nbsp;this problem except you install resistor to enlarge the wattage (SEE FAQ)　-- HYPER FLASH SPEED FOR SIGNAL/TURN LIGHT APPLICATION--Normally when you&nbsp;flip your turn signal switch, the light blinks at a set, slow pace. However, if&nbsp;you have modified your lightsto use LEDs,&nbsp;you'll notice that the turn signals now blink very quickly. This is caused by&nbsp;the low resistance of the LEDs due tothe fact that&nbsp;they use less energy. To correct the problem, you'll need to wire the turn&nbsp;signals in a parallel circuit. To do this,&nbsp;you'll be installing a resistor or control&nbsp;flasher.(SEE FAQ)&nbsp;　　　● Quantity: As Title Indicates● We use ANTI-STATICS&nbsp;ELECTRICITY BAG to pack your order but not LOW-QUALITY BLISTER CARD unless&nbsp;mentioned by the &nbsp;&nbsp; buyer.
