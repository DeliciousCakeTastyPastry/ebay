How are Oncor trees eco-friendly?
Oncor Recycled® Christmas Trees are made of 100% recycled PVC plastic instead of new plastic as many other trees are, thereby reducing the use of fossil fuels in manufacturing.&nbsp;
We use the best quality raw materials and tree parts to give all Oncor trees a minimum 30-year product life. Therefore, consumers can reuse our trees to make many joyful Christmases eco-friendly.&nbsp;
Oncor green boxes are made from strong recycled material cardboard so that consumers can continually reuse our boxes to store Oncor trees after Christmas.  &nbsp;
All Oncor tree trunks are made with a unique technology of paint-coating both sides of the metal pipes to prevent rust for at least 30 years.&nbsp;
We use only high-impact, high-density plastic hooks, hinges, and parts which will not crack or break after injection with normal wear and tear.&nbsp;
As a member of One Percent for the Planet, we donate at least 1% of sales to 1%FTP-approved non-profit environmental organizations.&nbsp;
Why do you only sell unlit trees?
In keeping with our purpose: "Making Christmas Eco-Friendly", we have opted to not produce pre-lit Christmas trees as most tree lights are prone to malfunction within a few years after purchase.&nbsp;
Consumers wishing to reuse pre-lit trees for many years may not have the required skills to properly take down, store, and set up these trees annually. There are many fire accidents and electric shocks caused by incorrect usage of pre-lit trees.&nbsp;
Pre-lit trees are pre-wired and strung with lights that cannot be removed from the trees, even when users want to change the colour of the lights or to replace damaged lights a few years after purchase.&nbsp;
Pre-lit trees are not made of recycled PVC plastic material because they are classified as electrical products and are subject to mandatory UL/CSA regulations. As such, pre-lit trees are not eco-friendly.&nbsp;
Pre-lit trees cannot be reused for 30 years as Oncor trees can. Pre-lit trees may also be a fire hazard to residential properties and can contain toxic heavy metals such as lead.&nbsp;
