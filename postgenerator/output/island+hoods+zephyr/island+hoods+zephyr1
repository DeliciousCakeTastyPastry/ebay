This energetic and inspired take on island hood design ushers the daring asymmetry of the Optica wall unit to the next level. Here, the steel is fashioned into a zigzag pattern which sets the senses into motion. The design integrates two sheets of tempered glass with a quartet of halogens to evoke a distinctive air of lightness and finely tuned balance.
