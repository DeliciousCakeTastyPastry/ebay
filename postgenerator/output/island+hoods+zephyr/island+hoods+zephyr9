Features:Includes a 715 CFM built-in blower to quickly clear your kitchen of unwanted air pollutionIlluminate your cooking area with 4 LED bulbsInnovative electronic LCD controls provide for unparalleled mastery of your kitchen environmentStainless steel constructionOptional ductless kit availableDuct cover extension available for ceilings up to 12' (sold separately)Product Technologies:Airflow Control Technology™: Zephyr hoods provide Airflow Control Technology™ which is a proprietary feature that limits blower CFM to 590, 390, or 290 to comply with local code restrictions.DCBL Suppression System™: The DCBL Suppression System® is the first range hood motor to use direct current (DC) energy. The result is a system with decreased ambient noise and increased power and efficiency. DCBL® hoods include Bloom™ HD LED lights and an on-board chip that monitors and optimizes your hood's performance.LCD Controls: Innovative backlit LCD screen displays useful information such as fan speed and lighting status, and is easily viewed in dark or dimly lit kitchens. Stylish electronic jewel buttons provide unparalleled mastery of your kitchen environment.Recirculating Range Hood (Optional): Recirculating range hoods require no external venting of air. Instead, air is pushed through a charcoal filtration system that removes pollutants before circulating it back into the home. The benefit of such a system is that household temperatures and humidity are easier to maintain, as the internal air never leaves the kitchen. A recirculating range hood is also generally far easier to install, as complex ventilation systems and vent pipe are not required.Bloom™ HD LED Lighting: Zephyr stands alone as the first to provide dimmable LED lights with their range hoods. These 3-watt bulbs emit light equal to that of a 20-watt halogen without producing unwanted temperature fluctuations on your stovetop. The result is a more inviting and comfortable environment to prepare the meals you love.Specifications:Maximum Ceiling Height: 144"Minimum Ceiling Height: 96"CFM: 250 to 715Width: 35-5/16"Depth: 25-9/16"Height: 50"Height Above Cooktop: 26" - 34"Voltage: 120Sones: 0.8 to 5.8Blower Speeds: 6Duct Discharge: VerticalProduct Variations:ZML-M90BS: 715 CFM 36" Wide Island Range Hood (This Model)ZMI-M90BG: 715 CFM 36" Wide Wall Mounted Range HoodZMI-M90BS: 715 CFM 36" Wide Wall Mounted Range HoodZML-E42BG: 715 CFM 42" Wide Island Range HoodZML-E42BS: 715 CFM 42" Wide Island Range HoodZML-M90BG: 715 CFM 36" Wide Island Range Hood

General Shipping Policy
Build has tried to make its shipping and handling prices and policies as fair as possible, so you benefit from our competitive pricing, plus the convenience of delivery to your door.
From the big to the small, we ship it all (mostly). Every shipment method we use is trackable and insured. We CANNOT change the shipping address once the order has been placed, please ensure your shipping address is correct. Below is a list of our shipment methods and their shipping times. All shipment times are shown in business days, which is Monday through Friday (no weekends), excluding holidays.*
Shipment times are average and remote locations, shipments during the winter holiday season, and cases of extreme weather may exceed the mentioned shipment times.1 Standard shipping&mdash;This means UPS, FedEx, DHL, USPS, or another common carrier that provides insurance and tracking. Shipments often need to be signed for, but shipments can also be left at the driver&rsquo;s discretion. Items shipped by this method have several &ldquo;speeds&rdquo;:
Standard Ground Shipping: 5-7 business days. This is our usual &ldquo;Free Shipping&rdquo; method. Shipments that are eligible for Free Shipping will have this option available. Shipment times are 5-7 business days.
&quot;Curb Side Delivery&quot; - AKA Freight or &ldquo;LTL&rdquo; Shipping&mdash;This is reserved for large, heavy, or oversized items such as large sinks, bathtubs, shower doors, etc. Items are palletized and loaded onto a large truck for shipment. Items are delivered by scheduled appointment by lift-gate for to-the-curb service. Be sure that all items are inspected for freight damage - by you - prior to the driver leaving. Any concealed damage must be reported within 7 business days. Any concealed damage reported to us after 7 days may no longer be eligible for a refund of any shipping costs paid, due to our inability to file a freight claim with the original carrier; Most carriers only accept claims for 7 days following delivery. Typical shipment time for freight deliveries is 7-10 business days.
1 Shipment time is the expected time from when a package leaves the warehouse, enters the carrier&rsquo;s service to when it arrives at the customer&rsquo;s shipment address. Expected Time to Ship (the time from when an order is placed to when an item is given to the shipment carrier) varies by product. Please read your product&rsquo;s details for further information.
We do our best to ensure that shipping is correctly calculated before you purchase; however, at times it may not be possible to do so accurately. Estimated Shipment Times
If your order is received before 11 A.M. Pacific Time, you can expect it to ship as follows: Plumbing (faucets, bathtubs, toilets, sinks, etc.): usually ships within 2 business days.
Lighting Fixtures: usually ship within 3 business days.
Hardware (door knobs, door levers, hinges, cabinet pulls, etc.): usually ships within 3 business days.
Ventilation (bath fans, range hoods, air purifiers): usually ships within 2 business days.
Tools (power tools, air tools, generators, etc.): usually ship within 3 business days.
During holidays, any orders received will not be processed until the next business day.

FAQ
FAQ
Do you offer combined shipping?
Yes. The best method for getting combined shipping is to use the "Add to Cart" button on the listing, build a single cart of all the items you are wanting to purchase, and then checkout once, this will ensure that if your order qualifies for free shipping you will not be charged for shipping.
Where do you ship from for US buyers?
We have distribution centers all over the United States and will ship from the closest one to your location where the product is in stock.
Can I get a discount?
We pride ourselves on not only low price, but also great service, but we can occasionally offer discounts on volume purchases. If you want to buy multiple quantities of the same product, multiple different products or found the item cheaper somewhere else please contact us and we will respond within 48 hours if we are able to offer a discount.
Do you ship internationally?
Yes, we use eBay's Global Shipping Program to ship to International buyers. We offers this program on most of our items but not all. You are responsible for knowing the compatibility of products for your country as we will NOT accept returns or exchanges from international buyers.
How much is international shipping?
Shipping will be fully calculated at checkout and will include any appropriate duties/taxes for your country. EBay calculates the final shipping since we use eBay's Global Shipping Program for international buyers. We do not accept returns or exchanges for international shipments so make sure the product will work in your country before purchase.
Will I receive a tracking number for international shipments?
Yes, you will receive multiple tracking numbers. One will be from us for the tracking from our distribution center to eBay's Global Shipping Program distribution center. EBay will then send you tracking number/s from the shipment from their warehouse to you. EBay is responsible for all shipping once the package leaves it's distribution center.
What countries do you ship to?
We ship to almost all countries, but not all for all products. We use eBay's Global Shipping Program for international buyers, so if you are unable to checkout because of where you live we will not be able to ship to you.
Do you offer combined shipping on international shipments?
Yes, but you must add all products to the cart before checking out. We use eBay's Global Shipping Program for international buyers and eBay will calculate your final shipping costs since they are responsible for shipping the product to you.

We do not accept any returns or exchanges for any reason from international buyers. It is your responsibility to know if a product will be compatible for your country. We cannot offer advice if a product will work for your country or application.

If you bought your item through eBay's GSP and it arrives damaged or incomplete you will have to contact eBay to place your claim. We are not responsible for the shipment once it leaves the US. Some products have a higher chance of damage, such as glass in lighting products, so please take this into account when you make your purchase. We will not replace glass if is arrives damaged.
I live outside of the US, will the product work for me?
If you are an international buyer it is your responsibility to know if a product will work for your country and application. We cannot give advice on compatibility since we do not know all the building codes, regulations and standards for all countries. We do not accept returns or exchanges for any reason from international buyers.
