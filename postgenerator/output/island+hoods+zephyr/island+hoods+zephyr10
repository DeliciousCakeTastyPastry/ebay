DESCRIPTIONA KITCHEN HOOD CAN DO MORE THAN VENT AIRWhen co-founder Alex Siow seized on the idea that everything in the home is an opportunity for personal expression, he began by elevating the hood to its rightful place: no longer an afterthought, the hood stands above all, as distinctive in its performance as it is in its beauty.Since the launch of their first hoods in 1997, they have remained true to their vision of delivering the unexpected-by deliberately seeking to change the marketplace. Alex was first to recognize the unmet demand for more powerful, professional-grade hoods in the home. And they answered with the Power series, high-CFM performers that put air quality concerns to rest with quiet efficiency - and raised the bar with self-cleaning, filter-free technologies never before available.After putting the power back into ventilation, the Europa line ushered in a new millennium with a style-forward clarion call to those who could find little inspiration above the range. Since then they have taken their vision ever higher, working with some of the world's best designers to find beauty in the everyday and create collections that are truly unlike any other.A wing-like arch - available in stainless steel or glass - is the defining mark of these airy, Deco-inspired hoods. The stainless steel option provides a durable, minimalist touch, while the glass canopy option lets natural light sift to the work surface below. Either way, expect uncompromising style and engineering - like an innovative quick-lock mounting system that ensures one of the easiest island hood installations on the market. And an optional recirculating kit that makes ductless installations a snap.SPECIFICATIONS
