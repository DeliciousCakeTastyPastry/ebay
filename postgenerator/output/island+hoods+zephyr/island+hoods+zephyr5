Retail List Price:  $23799.00
The Zephyr ZMLE42 Milano Island Hood is an evolution of the aesthetic sense of Art Deco, combining flowing elegance with state-of-the-art functionality to create a truly unified design. The stainless steel body elegantly drops down to meet a curved, glass hood, creating an impressive sculptural object and delivering plenty of natural light to the cooking surface. This unit comes with touch controls, a sensitive, low-profile button interface that insures easy cleaning and even easier operation. The hood comes equipped with six different speed settings for just the right amount of ventilation for the task at hand. When engaged, the hood will automatically power-down after 15 minutes, insuring that all remaining odors will be efficiently vented from the kitchen. Also this hood is equipped with all-halogen lighting to illuminate the cooking surface with a clean, long lasting and bright quality of light. To add to their appeal, Zephyr hoods are probably the quietest units available, with a loudness rating of only 6 sones.
