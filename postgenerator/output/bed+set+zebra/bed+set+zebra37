I package items how they should be packaged, if your shipping seems high, it is due to the weight and shipping used. &nbsp;I charge a minimum fee for supplies used and gas to the post office as we do not have postal pickup.&nbsp;All items, if needed will be washed down or washed if I think I can without damaging the product andadditional cleaning will be up to buyer.&nbsp;My home is a non smoking home.

My items are used for the most part I will let you know if they are not.&nbsp;I answer questions through the ebay auction site only, so please ask there.&nbsp;I try very hard to ship next day after payment, unless on Friday evening or weekend, then packages wait until Monday. I will email you when I ship. All payments must be made in 3 days from auction end. If payment is not received I will file a case with Ebay. I do hold a regular job, I pack when items are bid on, so please let me know of the possibility of buying more than one item, if items are already packed I cannot guarantee that I can repack.&nbsp;I try to describe items to the best of my ability, on occasion a mistake or an overlook can take place. I do not intentionally want to mislead or misrepresent my products. Please ask a question if something is not clear or you are in doubt.&nbsp;Please do not be offended, but if something arrives broken, I will ask for a digital photo. I accept returns only if item was grossly misrepresented or breakage is my fault. I take special care in wrapping and shipping as you can see by my feedback.&nbsp;Thanks for looking and come back again.
