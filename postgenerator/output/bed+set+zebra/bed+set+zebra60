Our original business plan took an unexpected turn and we ended up getting shut down by the big corporations. However, we were not going to give up. Since we already had a building, we created a store front and started reselling items that were part of shelf pulls from big companies.All of these items would come in on pallets on big semi-trucks. The first truck load we ever received ended up being unloaded all by hand in our driveway since we did not have a warehouse at the time. A lot of thses items have labels stuck to or removed from the packaging. A crew was hired to go through the items to make sure they were in working condition before they were put on our store shelves.One day, we recieved a HUGE order of Genie Bras. We didn't know what we were going to do with all of these bras. Then, an idea came about. Lets post them on eBay. Suddenly, they were selling like hot cakes. So eventually we started posting more items on eBay and low and behold, they were selling!!In November 2013, we moved all of our employees and merchandise to a warehouse. We were now a full functioning eBay store. After about 2 years of selling on eBay, we decided we need a change. So we created our own site and hired a crew to create a program that would disperse our items throughout 24 different shopping sites. Today, we have a crew of about 15 employees that post new items daily and work hard to get all the items shipped out on time.Even though there were bumps throughout our journey, we made it to where we are today.At crazy4tank we work hard to satisfy all customers and make sure that they have the best experience at our online store. Thank you for visting our site and reading our story. We hope you are satisfied with your experience! Powered by Shopping Cart Elite
