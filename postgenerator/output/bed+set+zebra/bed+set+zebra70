POOR QUALITY
1 out of 5 Stars
Opened comforter and went to spread it across the bed and a botton fell off. I ordered a king size to have extra length and it is too short on ALL sides... NOW I have to pay over $$$ to ship it back...........

Not quite what I expected.

This bedset is nice, but it's not what I expected at all. The zebra print part is soft, but it's not the traditional black and white like I thought. It also has grey in it. And the textures of the bed are not as lucious as I thought them to be. They're rough and very cheaply put together.

Cheap cheap cheap. 2 out of 5 Stars
We didnt even keep this item. Total junk. Flocking was missing when we unwrapped it. Seams rip out after a few nights on the bed. Loved it in photos but said photos hide the awful construction. Would NOT recommend. Kendra V.

POOR QUALITY...Save your money...
1 out of 5 Stars
Loved, loved, loved what I saw online...however, I was not smart and IGNORED the comments that described the quality of this product as there was a review or two on it that said the opposite...I'm hear to tell you, you do not even have to touch this comforter to see that what is in zebra print looks and feels like polyester...it is prone to tearing easily. We bought this for our 12 year old and she loved the look, but not the feel. Also the cute buttons came off easily. This comforter is not one that can be washed as it is so delicate it will fall apart. Another note...we ordered the Queen size for her bed and it fit her queen pillow top like a full...it did not cover the length of the bed like a true queen comforter should.
